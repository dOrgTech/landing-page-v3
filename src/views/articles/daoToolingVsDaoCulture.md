First, let's take a look at the definition of each concept:

**DAO tooling** refers to the technology and software tools that are used to create and manage decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These tools include Smart Contract platforms such as Ethereum, **Software Development** Kits (SDKs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to build and deploy decentralized applications, and tools for governance and decision-making such as voting systems and reputation systems.

**DAO culture**, on the other hand, refers to the values, norms, and practices that are followed within a DAO. This can include things like the principles that guide the organization's decision-making, the roles and responsibilities of members and the processes for resolving disputes and managing conflicts. DAO culture can also encompass the overall community and social dynamics within the organization, including how members communicate and collaborate with one another. For example, dOrg's main symbol of our DAO culture is the [Handbook.](https://docs.dorg.tech)

In conclusion: There's no "vs" between these two terms, because they complement each other to complete a DAO.

Both DAO tooling and DAO culture are important components of a successful **DAO**. The right tooling can facilitate the efficient operation and management of the organization, while a positive and productive culture can foster collaboration and help the organization achieve its goals.

It is important for a DAO to prioritize both **DAO tooling** and **DAO culture**. The right tooling is necessary for the efficient operation and management of the organization, while a positive and productive culture can foster collaboration and help the organization achieve its goals.

That said, the specific priorities of a DAO may depend on the specific needs and goals of the organization. For example, if a DAO is just starting out and is focused on creating and deploying its first set of dApps, it may prioritize finding the right tools and creating a technical infrastructure.

On the other hand, if a DAO is already established and is looking to improve its decision-making processes or resolve conflicts within the organization, it may prioritize building a positive culture and establishing clear rules and practices for governance.

Ultimately, it is important for a DAO to find a balance between the two and consider how they can support and enhance each other. By prioritizing both the tools and the culture of the DAO, a DAO can set itself up for long-term success and sustainability.

To build a strong, positive DAO culture, here are some steps you can take:

**Establish clear values and principles:** define the values and principles that will guide the organization's decision making and behavior. These can include things like transparency, accountability and collaboration.

**Communicate effectively:** Establish clear channels of communication within the organization and encourage open and honest dialogue among members.

**Foster collaboration and inclusivity:** Encourage members to work together and collaborate towards common goals. Make sure that all members feel welcome and included in the decision-making process.

**Establish clear roles and responsibilities:** Define the roles and responsibilities of members within the organization and make sure that everyone understands their responsibilities.

**Set up systems for conflict resolution:** Establish clear processes for resolving conflicts and managing disputes within the organization.

**Encourage continuous learning and growth:** Encourage members to learn and grow as individuals and as a team. This could include things like training programs, mentorship opportunities, and professional development resources.

As for **DAO** tools, there are many options available, depending on your specific needs and objectives. Some popular toolkits for creating and managing DAOs are Aragon, DAOstack, JuiceBox, Open Law, Tally, etc.These toolkits provide a range of features and functionality for things like governance, decision making and collaboration. It is worth considering which toolset best suits your specific needs and goals.

For example, in **dOrg** some of the [tools](https://docs.dorg.tech/tool-stack) we use are Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, Utopia Labs, and Discourse.
