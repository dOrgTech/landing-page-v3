To become a Smart Contract developer in 2023, you will need to have good knowledge of at least one programming language that can be used to write Smart Contracts, such as Solidity or Vyper.

It's also helpful to have a good understanding of **Blockchain technology** and how it works, as well as the specific platform you'll be working with (such as Ethereum). In addition, it can be helpful to have knowledge of **Web development** technologies, as many Smart Contracts are accessed and interacted through web interfaces.

Finally, it is important to have strong problem-solving and communication skills, as you will need to be able to effectively design and implement Smart Contract solutions to meet the needs of your customers or users.

Now let's take a look at the technical part of becoming a **Smart Contract Developer**:

To become a **Smart Contract Developer**, you will need to learn about the **Ethereum** platform and the Solidity programming language. Here are some steps you can take to get started:

1. Learn about **Blockchain technology** and the Ethereum platform. You can start by reading the Ethereum white paper and other resources to understand how Ethereum works and what it is used for.

2. Learn about **Smart Contracts**. A Smart Contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist on the **Blockchain** network.

3. Learn Solidity. Solidity is the most popular programming language for writing **Smart Contracts** in the **Ethereum** platform. You can find resources online to learn Solidity, such as online tutorials and courses.

4. Practice writing Smart Contracts. You can use a tool like Remix, an online Solidity compiler and debugger, to write and test your **Smart Contracts**.

5. Join a community of **developers**. There are many online communities of **Ethereum developers** where you can ask questions and get feedback on your code.

6. Consider earning a certification. There are several organizations that offer certification programs for **Ethereum developers**, such as the Ethereum Foundation and ConsenSys Academy.

If you are looking to improve your skills and expertise in these areas, joining a DAO such as dOrg can be a good way to access resources and gain hands-on experience.

Also, if you want to build a Web3 project in which it is required a deep knowledge of software and Smart Contract development, hiring our services can leverage your idea and project to the next level.

dOrg is a group of developers with experience in building **decentralized applications** and infrastructures using **Web3 technologies**.
