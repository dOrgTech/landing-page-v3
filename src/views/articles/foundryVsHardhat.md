From Truffle we went to Hardhat and now we have Foundry. But which one is better, which one to choose?

In this article we make a comparison between the favorite **development** tools of the moment:

**Hardhat and Foundry.**

Both are toolkits for development and testing of **Smart Contracts on Ethereum**.

But obviously, they are far away from being the same. That's why, in this article we'll explain what each one consists of and the pros and cons, so that you can decide which one suits you or you prefer to develop with.

Foundry is a **development toolkit** that includes local development, testing and **Smart Contract** deployment tools. The goal of creating this tool is to facilitate the creation and testing of **Smart Contracts**.

Hardhat serves the same function, it includes a development environment with deployment tools, a local **Blockchain** and contract testing, but its ultimate goal changes, Hardhat focuses on providing a _secure_ development environment for creating and testing **Smart Contracts**.

Hardhat is considered to be the most popular because it is actively maintained and updated.

Both tools are good for developing and testing **Smart Contracts on Ethereum**, but to make a decision between which one to use, it is best to try them both and when using them, decide according to what the developer personally wants.

Even though, Foundry and Hardhat functionally are very similar, they have some key differences:

- Foundry was created to build, deploy and manage **DeFi applications** on **Ethereum**, and has a **Smart Contract development** framework, a means of deployment and other tools to interact with **Ethereum**.
- Hardhat is most commonly used to create and TEST **Smart Contracts on Ethereum**. It also includes a local development Blockchain, test runner and tools to analyze and debug **Smart Contracts**.

Basically, each has a specialization and each is "best" in specific cases.

If your intention is to use a tool that has general functions for building and testing **Smart Contracts**, Hardhat is positioned as a better choice, Foundry is much more targeted and works optimally for **DeFi applications**.

When choosing between Hardhat and Foundry, there are a few key factors to consider:

**Use:** In order to choose which of the two to use, it is best to be clear about the purpose for which the tool is needed.

**Functions:** Hardhat offers a local development Blockchain, a test runner and a set of tools for debugging and analyzing contracts.

Foundry, meanwhile, offers a Smart Contract development framework, a deployment pipeline and a set of tools for interfacing with Ethereum.

**Community:** Both tools have active communities, so we suggest you visit their Github repository and choose for yourself which one suits you best and has better resources.

**Integration:** Hardhat can be integrated with other tools such as Truffle. Foundry on the other hand has its own **development** framework, depending on your work and the tools you use, you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

**Learning curve:** Definitely between these tools the learning curve is very different, to compare this factor, the ideal is to try them yourself and choose which one is more comfortable for you.
