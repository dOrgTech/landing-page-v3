### **1. Access to a +100 Top-end Senior Dev Pool**

Since 2019, at **dOrg** we have onboarded +80 top-end senior developers with different expertises in the web3 development field. This gives us a wide range of possibilities at the moment of assembling a team for a client project.

In our selective recruitment process **web3 developers** need to prove their technical senior expertise through technical interviews, verification of their previous work, code reviews, culture fit and approval from our Tech Leads and broader collective. Some of our builders came from big tech companies like: Microsoft, Meta, Google, IBM, Morgan Standley, Amazon, Barclays, etc.

### **2. Fast 24-72h Team Assembly**

Our **DAO**’s pool of +80 top-end senior dev pool allows us to assemble custom teams in 24-72 hours vs +35 days of regular hiring process. Our clients can leverage these resources and adjust their ideal candidates before starting the engagement or during the process if needed.**

### **3. Dedicated Quality Assurance**

In all our client projects we assign a Tech Lead Developer that ensures code quality and rigorous testing and adherence to high-quality standards: from manual and automated testing to performance and security testing including getting everything ready before auditing.

We provide project management services, ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget, managing workflows and deliverables effectively.

### **4. Plug and Play setup with your Organization**

Our teams are ready to work with you in different set-ups: as your team extension like your in-house devs, on a milestone based or bounty project that you outsource us, or if you need we can help out on research and consulting to propose the best strategic development before the actual execution of it. You choose.

### **5. Reduce Hiring Bureaucracy to a Single Contract**

Forget about contract management, tax responsibilities, employee benefits administration or compliance issues for each builder or contractor. dOrg relieves its clients of the bureaucracy burden and manages all these aspects, so you can focus on what’s actually important.

### **6. Reduce Workload to Managing and Senior Tech Positions**

Partnering with an agency eliminates the need for hiring, training, and retaining in-house developers. We can save you time, money, and workload. This spares you from needing to hire additional staff to manage your team’s experience and motivation.

### **7. Flexible Team Customization**

At dOrg we offer the ability to ramp up for a large project or scale down the team based on project needs without the added friction of firing, hiring, training, managing, etc. afterwards which leads to more efficient use of resources and time. We just offer the flexibility to adjust team size and skills as needed.

### **8. Reduce payment complexity to one invoice/month**

Receive a single monthly invoice (or bi-weekly if preferred) for the entire project team, simplifying your payment process and reducing administrative hassle. This efficient approach streamlines budgeting and expense tracking. Upon receipt, the team distributes funds internally to ensure prompt compensation.

### **9. Ability to hire directly after collaboration**

dOrg enables direct hire service after collaboration to seamlessly transition from working with an agency to bringing on talent in-house, as you’ll be able to evaluate the agency's team members during the project.

### **10. Ongoing Development, Support and Maintenance**

We offer long term partnerships to keep up to date the work done, including extending protocol development, continuously improving your web3 application, updating your DAO Development, building new collaborative tools or adding new custom Web3 development (including Smart Contracts, Integrations, ML) to your roadmap. This is the set up of projects like Gnosis (Safe), Tezos or Starkware from 2021 to the date!

### **Conclusion**

Whether you need flexibility, quality assurance, or innovative solutions, a development agency like dOrg can help you achieve your goals with confidence and accelerate your development roadmap through a comprehensive approach of your needs.
